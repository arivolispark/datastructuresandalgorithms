Title:  Counting Bits

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in
the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary
representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]


Example 2:
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]


Follow up:

1) It is very easy to come up with a solution with
run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can
you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
2) Space complexity should be O(n).
3) Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using
any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or
in any other language.
