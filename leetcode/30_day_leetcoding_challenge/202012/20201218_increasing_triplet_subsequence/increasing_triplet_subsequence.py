Title:  Increasing Triplet Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of
indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k].  If no
such indices exists, return false.



Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.



Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: No triplet exists.



Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The triplet (3, 4, 5) is valid because nums[3] == 0 < nums[4] == 4 < nums[5] == 6.


Constraints:

1) 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
2) -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1


Follow up: Could you implement a solution that runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity?
