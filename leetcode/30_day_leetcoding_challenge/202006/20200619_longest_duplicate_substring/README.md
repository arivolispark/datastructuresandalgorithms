String Searching Algorithms:
<br/>
The problem is a follow-up of Longest Repeating Substring, and typically used to check if you're comfortable with string searching algortihms.
<br/>
Best algorithms have a linear execution time in average. The most popular ones are Aho-Corasick, KMPand Rabin-Karp: Aho-Corasick is used by fgrep, KMP is used for chinese string searching, and Rabin-Karp is used for plagiarism detection and in bioinformatics to look for similarities in two or more proteins.

<br/>
The first two are optimised for a single pattern search, and Rabin-Karp for a multiple pattern search, that is exactly the case here.
