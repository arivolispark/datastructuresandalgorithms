<br/>
**String Searching Algorithms:**
<br/>
The problem is a follow-up of **Longest Repeating Substring**, and typically used to check if you're comfortable with **string searching algortihms**.
<br/>
<br/>
Best algorithms have a linear execution time in average.  The most popular ones are **Aho-Corasick**, **KMP** and **Rabin-Karp**.
<br/>
Aho-Corasick is used by **fgrep**.
**KMP** is used for **Chinese string searching**.
**Rabin-Karp** is used for **Plagiarism detection** and in **Bioinformatics to look for similarities in two or more proteins**.

<br/>
The first two are optimised for a single pattern search, and Rabin-Karp for a multiple pattern search, that is exactly the case here.
