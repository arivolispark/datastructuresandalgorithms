**String Searching Algorithms:**
<br/>
The problem is a follow-up of **Longest Repeating Substring**, and typically used to check if you're comfortable with **string searching algortihms**.
Best algorithms have a linear execution time in average.  The most popular ones are **Aho-Corasick**, **KMP** and **Rabin-Karp**.

<br/>

| S.No. | Algorithm | Application
| --- | --- | --- 
| 1 | Aho-Corasick | is used by fgrep 
| 2 | KMP | is used for Chinese string searching 
| 3 | Rabin-Karp | is used for Plagiarism detection and in Bioinformatics to look for similarities in two or more proteins

<br/>
The first two are optimised for a single pattern search, and Rabin-Karp for a multiple pattern search, that is exactly the case here.
