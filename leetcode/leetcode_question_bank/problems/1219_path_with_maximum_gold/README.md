# NP problems

NP problems are exponential.  It is better to try for a solution first, instead of optimizing as well.  Typically, optimizations make minimal impact for NP problems.

## Examples of NP problems
1. NP-completeness - Wikipedia
2. NP-complete problems
3. Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT)
4. Knapsack problem
5. Hamiltonian path problem
6. Travelling salesman problem (decision version)
7. Subgraph isomorphism problem
8. Subset sum problem
9. Clique problem
10. Vertex cover problem
